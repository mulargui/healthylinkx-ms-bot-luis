# healthylinkx-ms-bot-luis

Healthylinkx helps you find doctors with the help of your social network. Think of Healthylinkx as a combination of Yelp, Linkedin and Facebook. 

This is an early prototype that combines open data of doctors and specialists from the US Department of Health. It allows you to search for doctors based on location, specialization, genre or name. You can choose up to three doctors in the result list and Healthylinkx (theoretically) will book appointments for you.

Healthylinx is a classic three tiers app: front-end (ux), service API and data store. It also integrates with a third-party API from RedLine13 (https://www.redline13.com) to find zip codes in an area.

This repo builds a bot interface (microsoft bot framework) integrated with LUIS to support natural language
